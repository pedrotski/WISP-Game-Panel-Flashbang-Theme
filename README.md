# WISP-Game-Panel-Flashbang-Theme
A light mode CSS theme for the WISP game panel. This was beta theme we were going to use for [Game Host Bros](https://www.gamehostbros.com/), but never kept it so there may be some bugs. 

To change the accent color of the theme, find and replace the #4F46E5 color.
